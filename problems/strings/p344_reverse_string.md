### Problem 344. Reverse String

#### Problem Description:

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

    Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
    Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

    Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
    Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s[i] is a printable ascii character.

#### Starter Code:

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn reverse_string(s: &mut Vec<char>) {

    }
}
```
